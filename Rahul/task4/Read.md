In this project I have added two features. These are:

        1. Voice Search (it is totally implemented)
        2. Login System through which we can sync the data with user's account as similar to gmail and google.(it is not implemented fully but i am trying to do so)
        3. One Home Key--- it will help the user to comeback to home page from any page which is far away from it. 
        
In this project I want to some more features. These are:

        1. Voice Search Assitant --- Through which we can Search the only by using microphone like "Glugle Search Python" after saying this a new page will get open with results.
        2. Syncing the Google Searches with your login account which will help in syncing your searches and if user ever changes the device then user will retrive all those things according to his likes.
        3. PageRanking Algorithm
        4. Settings Menu
        
        
Voice Search --- I have made this one using Webkitsearch API which helps in converting the voice into text.
